Follow the instructions below to pass the tests for this lab. If you're unfamiliar with the concept of variables, don't worry. Just follow along with the instructions - we'll talk about variables and data types much more in the next few lessons!"

    "3. Copy the URL of your repository\n",
    "4. Open a terminal window (terminal on a Mac, Git Bash on Windows)\n",
    "5. Make sure to activate your conda virtual environment so you have the right version of Python and all of the necessary packages. On a mac, type `source activate learn-env`. On windows, type `activate learn-env`.\n",
    "6. Clone (download) the files to your hard drive by typing `git clone ` and then pasting the URL of your repo you saved in step 3.\n",
    "7. Type `cd ` followed by the name of the directory you just created (running the `ls` command will show you the name of the directory you downloaded) \n",

    "> **Bonus tip, if you'd like to be able to run commands on the command line or tests without having to stop (`ctrl-C`) and start Jupyter, open a new tab or window in your terminal window, navigate to the same directory, activate your conda vm, and now you can do things like running tests (`python -m pytest -x`) without having to start and stop your Jupyter notebook.**"
